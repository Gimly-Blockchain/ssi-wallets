## SSI Cross Wallet Support
In general, parties issue credentials using one specific protocol that only a certain selection of wallets can handle. Similarly, verifiers request credentials (presentations) using a specific protocol that not all wallets handle. Rather than choosing a set of wallets to support and implement the protocols for each of them, verifiers as well as issuers can use the (open source) [eassi](https://eassi.ssi-lab.nl/docs/about) tools to interact with (an ever increasing set of) different user wallets. Parties may contact [Peter Langenkamp](mailto:peter.langenkamp@tno.nl) and/or [Michiel Stornebrink](mailto:michiel.stornebrink@tno.nl) to discuss adding still unsupported wallets.
